## ODKInteractor Interface

The OdkInteractor interface is a key component of the ODK Interactor Module, which provides developers with methods for setting up, configuring, and resetting ODK, as well as opening a form. Using a JSON string, developers can configure ODK by pulling configuration information from a JSON file. The open form functionality not only ensures that the form exists on the device, but also checks for the required XML file and media files. If these files are not present on the device, the module will automatically download them from the server.

***Methods:***

`fun setupODK(settingsJson: String, lazyDownload: Boolean, listener: ODKProcessListener)`

This method sets up the ODK environment according to a given configuration, and optionally downloads all available forms. This method must be called before any other method. \
***Parameters:*** \
`settingsJson` - A string representing the configuration for the ODK environment. \
`lazyDownload` - A Boolean indicating whether to download all available forms immediately. \
`listener` - An ODKProcessListener object to receive callbacks during the setup process.

<br>

`fun resetODK(listener: ODKProcessListener)`

This method resets the ODK environment and deletes all data. \
***Parameters:*** \
`listener` - An ODKProcessListener object to receive callbacks during the reset process.
